                            <br> My passion is programming for multiple reasons one of which is the sense of improvement since
                            there's always something new to learn whether it's a new language, a new API, a new concept or
                            so much more. My strongest points as of right now are Unity with C#, Java, JavaScript &#38; C++
                            and in teams we use SCRUM.
                            <br>
                            <br>In my freetime I like to talk with people, improve my programming by looking up documentations
                            and trying new things, I play games like Super Mario and Counter Strike and I play guitar.</p>
